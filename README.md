# EdmondsOnline.com
EdmondsOnline repo - Simple Blog Site to work with Flask

Side project that started with a blog following https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/ 

The project has evoled into a more complete COVID community for Edmonds.
The EdmondsOnline.com project helps people: 
•	Communicate their needs
•	Organize and schedule store runs to pick up items people needed
(this would minimize people going into stores and tell us what people are running low on)
•	Support local merchants by listing their take-out specials and contact info
•	Gather data on the current COVID-19 situation and present it in once place
•	Provide a platform for people to talk about how they are doing and reach out if they need anything
